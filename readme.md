# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in C++.

## Overview

This program allows two players to take turns marking cells in a 3x3 grid until one of them achieves a winning pattern - either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends in a draw if all cells are filled without a winner.

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game:** Compile the C++ code provided (`main.cpp`) and run the executable.
2. **Game Layout:** The game layout is displayed at the start, showcasing a 3x3 grid of cells.
3. **Player Turns:** Players take turns entering the cell number they wish to mark.
4. **Winning Condition:** The game ends when a player achieves a winning pattern or when all cells are filled.
5. **Restart:** Players can choose to restart the game after a win, loss, or draw.

## Features

- **Player Turns:** Alternates between 'X' and 'O' for each player.
- **Validation:** Validates input for cell selection and prevents marking already filled cells.
- **Display:** Renders the game board with each move.
- **Win Detection:** Detects winning patterns and declares the winner.
- **Draw Handling:** Handles the situation where all cells are filled without a winner.

## Usage

- Compile the `main.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
- Run the generated executable file.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
